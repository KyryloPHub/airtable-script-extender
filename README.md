# Airtable Script Extender

JavaScript is amazing. 

Project management less so. 

Airtable's Scripting app allows us to cut through a lot of red tape in the form of npm-prefixed CLI commands.

This repo aims to make the most that luxury.

Ping me if you need or want to use any particular component (file) commercially and I'll give you a written permission within a day or two.
Some of the included scripts might already be licensed individually.
You should be able to recognize them, but just to be sure: if a source code starts with a sizable block of text telling you it's a
free software license - it's a free software license, I promise.
